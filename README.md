# StudyCards




<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A study card application. I built this application to get a better understanding of SwiftUI and Combine. I have read how SwiftUI and Combine work, but I learn much better by doing.</p>


<h2>How to Setup</h2>
Create a Firebase account - https://firebase.google.com/ <br>
Install Firebase using Swift package manager https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git

<h2>How to Use</h2>
Create any cards you wish to study, click on a card to flip it over and mark whether you got the answer correct or not.

<h2>Credits</h2>
Largely inspired by Ray Wenderlich's Firestore tutorial.
